HW5 assignment 
This is a homework 5 assignment for GUI class. I used forms to invoke the user to enter valid 2 ranges of numbers in order
to generate a multiplication table of the numbers of the ranges. I added avaldiation function in the JS file to make sure the user enter a valid range before generating the table.
 I used JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap to complete this assignment. 
I used examples from the lecture and https://www.w3schools.com/ to learn about JavaScript and bootstrap.
